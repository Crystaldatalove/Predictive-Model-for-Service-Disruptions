Code: PBL Telecomm Project with Dmatrices method-Final-Copy1.ipynb notebook file.


Dataset: event_type.csv, log_feature.csv, resource_type.csv, severity_type.csv, train.csv


Dataset dictionary - the dataset consists of the following fields:

•ID: identifies a unique location-time point.

•Location: indentifier of location.

•Fault_Severity: categorical - 0 : no fault; 1 : a few faults; 2 : many faults.
